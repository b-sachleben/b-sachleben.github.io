# ***Front End Web Development class project***
### Brian Sachleben
###### *January - March 2017*

&nbsp;
This is a website I designed to showcase the skills I learned in Code Louisville's
Front End Web Development course.  The purpose of this site is to showcase a few of
my photographs online in a portfolio.  In the future I would like to extend
this format to market my graphic design and illustration projects for prospective
freelance work.  

*To view this website, open the index.html file or navigate to **[this page](https://b-sachleben.github.io)**.*

Some of the web technologies used in the creation of this page include:

* jQuery to add interactability to the webpage - specifically for the functionality
 of the image gallery and the top menu.
* AJAX to dynamically load images into the page using information fed by a JSON file
* The Bootstrap front end framework to make the page responsive and to utilize its
 grid system for the layout.

*Thanks for watching.*
